battle_time
===========

This short script lets you select character stats and execute one battle attack.

The damage done by your attack can be anywhere from 0 to 100. Damage is based on one or two stats multiplied by a luck modifier. The luck modifier is a random number between 0 and your Luck stat.

Some attacks have a binary outcome (success or failure). In these cases, the outcome is determined by comparing the damage value to 50. 50 or greater damage leads to a successful attack.

Next steps: adding a limit to total skill points; turning it into a full battle; adding an option to heal damage.
